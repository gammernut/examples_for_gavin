# variables

# variables should start with lowercase and use a underscore ie. var_1 var_2
# variable names should be descriptive even if that means making it long so that you can understand what it is better

spam = 40
print(spam)
eggs = 2
print(eggs)
print(spam+eggs)

# the above code is fine but this is cleaner

spam = 40
eggs = 2

print(spam)
print(eggs)
print(spam+eggs)


spam = 40
eggs = 2
spam = 3

print(spam+eggs)

# when a variable is given a new value its old one is forgotten


ddddddddfuv = 3
 print(ddddddddfuv)
