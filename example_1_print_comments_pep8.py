# print , comments and pep8

# python is CASE sensitive

# this is a commit its standard practice to put a spaces after the hash sigh

# in most editors highlighting multiple lines then pressing ctrl+/ comments or un-comments those lines

# pep 8 is what decides python standers for writing code
# basically means you should do a thing so its easier for people to read
# but is not technical required for the code to run

# print prints a thing in the console

print('hello world')  # its standard practice to put two spaces before the hash sigh
# you can also add a comment after a line of code

Print('hello world')  # will throw a error whats wrong?

print('hello world')  # correct by pep8 standers

print ('hello world')  # wrong by pep8 standers

print( 'hello world' )  # wrong by pep8 standers

# pep8 asks for a blank line at the end of the file
